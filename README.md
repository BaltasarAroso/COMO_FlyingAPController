# User-Aware Flying AP Project

This project belongs to the Curricular Unit of Mobile Communications and it was divided into three main parts:
* FAP Android App
* FAP Management Protocol
* FAP Controller + AP.

This report is mainly about the last one, where weâ€™ve needed to implement the FAP Controller in C and to configure the Access Point.

## Execution for the FAP Controller Code Test
```
git clone https://github.com/BaltasarAroso/FAPController_AP.git
make run_test
```

## Execution for the FAP Access Point test
Related to this point, the configurations are explained in the final report 'Report_v2_final'.
