This report is mainly about the last one, where weâ€™ve needed to implement the FAP Controller in C and to configure the Access Point.

## Execution for the FAP Controller Code Test
```
git clone https://github.com/BaltasarAroso/FAPController_AP.git
make run_test
```

## Execution for the FAP Access Point test
The configurations files for this point are in the folder "AccessPoint_config" and those configurations are explained in the final report 'Report_Final_Version'.
